    <h2 id="education">The Educational Researcher</h2>
    <p>Stephen Krashen is a Professor at the University of Southern California, He is a meritus alumni
  of this Instituition. He has dedicated his career to understanding the process of second language aquisition and he has contributed greatly
to the advancement of it.</p>
<p>Dr. Krashen is a world renowned linguist, educational researcher and activist. Since 1994, his research focus shifted from linguistics
  to the study of education. He is best known for the development of the first comprehensive theory of second language acquisition, and
  is also the co-inventor of the Natural Approach in language teaching. He has published more than 350 papers and books, mainly on bilingual
  education and reading. He also promotes free voluntary reading during second language acquisition, which means students are free to choose a
  book that they like and are allowed to read it at their own pace. The aim is to help them enjoy reading, so assessment is usually minimized
  or there is none at all. During a campaign to enact an anti-bilingual education law in California, Dr. Krashen became
  an activist and campaigned aggressively in variuos media, writing over 1,000 letters to the editor defending bilingual education.</p>
<p>Krashen has among papers (peer-reviewed and not) and books, more than 486 publications, contributing to the fields of second-language acquisition, bilingual education, and reading.[2]
  He is known[citation needed] for introducing various hypotheses related to second-language acquisition, including the acquisition-learning hypothesis, the input hypothesis,
  the monitor hypothesis, the affective filter, and the natural order hypothesis.[3] Most recently, Krashen promotes the use of free voluntary reading during second-language acquisition,
  which he says "is the most powerful tool we have in language education, first and second."[4]</p>
  <p>Due to his works many renovating methodologies were created, inspired by his teachings, some which have revolutionised
  second language teaching. Many Second Language teaching schools around the world use his methods.</p>
